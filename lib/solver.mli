    [forbid].

exception Schedule_failure of (string * string) list * (string * string) list
(** Exception raised when [schedule] fails to find a suitable order.
    The arguments are: the schedule found so far and the set of remaining

(** [schedule u prev sol target]
    Return the solution [sol], in an order that allows installing
    the packages one by one. [prev] must be a subset of [sol], and
    will be a prefix of the result. If [target] is reached before
    all packages are installed then the remaining packages are
    omitted from the solution.
